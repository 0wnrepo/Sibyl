[ Bug fix ]


[ Minor corrections ]


[ Style change for new code ]

postincrement->preincrement in for loops
for (auto it = std::begin, end = std::end; it != end; ++it) style loops (unless end is being modified inside loop)

[ Simulation ]

- Likely cause for real-simulation difference is tb.q data delay vs tr data which invalidates trade amount for large orders that do not fit below both real-time & delayed tb.q
- Getting DMA may resolve this issue
- However, impossible to accurately estimate behavior *after* q0 is emptied anyways

Try: limiting tr trades to p_1 max to see if accuracy improves
