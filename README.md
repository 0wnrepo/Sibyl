# Sibyl

*Sibyl*
(**S**imulation of **I**ntraday **B**ook and **Y**ield with **L**imit-orders)
is a platform for backtesting and live-trading with real-time intraday
Stock/ETF/ELW data, with a special focus on training and evaluating recurrent
neural networks (RNNs) for forming trade signals.

It adopts a server/client model with a TCP communication channel, allowing
exactly the same code to be used for both backtesting and live-trading, on
distributed systems or within the same system.
- Server side
  - backtesting simulator
  - agent for relaying order request/status to/from a broker
- Client side
  - order request generators using RNNs (for real-time)
  - order request generators using pre-calculated reference target signals
    (for testing)


## Requirements
Project was developed using g++ 5.4.0 with `-std=c++11`.
Version numbers are not hard requirements.

### RNN backends
- [Fractal](https://github.com/KyuyeonHwang/Fractal) (commit `261f1fd`)
  : based on C++/*CUDA*; faster than *Sophia*
- [Sophia](https://github.com/junosan/Sophia) (commit `3ab4359`)
  : based on Python/*Theano*; less VRAM usage than *Fractal*,
    and more flexibility in experimental RNN structures
  - [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano_versions/dev/index.html)
    (0.9.0b1) with
    [libgpuarray](http://deeplearning.net/software/libgpuarray)
    (0.6.0)
    : symbolic computation library for multi-dimensional arrays
  - [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) (4.2.0)
    with [C++ binding](https://github.com/zeromq/cppzmq) (commit `1fdf3d1`)
    : messaging library, used for real-time inference using RNNs trained by
      *Sophia* via interprocess communication (IPC) or over a network (TCP)

*Fractal* is required, *Sophia* (*Theano*, *ZeroMQ*) is optional.
With regards to backtesting/live-trading, both function identically.

### Common
- [Eigen](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) (3.3.2)
  : Linear algebra library, used for data preprocessing

### Broker frontends (optional)
This project has been tested extensively in South Korean KOSPI market using 
*Kiwoom Securities* OpenAPI.
Following two repositories provide frontends for collecting real-time data
and executing live trades through this broker.

- [KiwoomScribe](https://github.com/junosan/KiwoomScribe)
  : collect level 1 (top of the book quotes and trades) and partial
    level 2 (order book up to Â±10 ticks) Stock/ETF/ELW data with
    1 second resolution
- [KiwoomAgent](https://github.com/junosan/KiwoomAgent)
  : relay order requests from *Sibyl* to the market, and market data &
    order status updates from the market to *Sibyl*


## Block diagram
The procedure for data collection, modeling, training, backtesting,
and live-trading are summarized in the following diagram.

<img src="readme/block_diagram.png" width="640"/>

There are 4 constituents of a trading model in this diagram:
- **Return model**
  : given the state (possibly also including past and *future* states) of a
    security, determines expected return of an action;
    this is not a part of this repository
- **Reshaper model**
  : process input & target/output of RNN in a way that makes more sense
    for an RNN to learn;
    `class Reshaper` in `src/core/rnn` and its derived classes
- **RNN model**
  : given preprocessed input, generate output, which becomes a real-time
    estimation of the target after Reshaper processing;
    `class TradeNet` in `src/core/rnn` and its derived classes
- **Portfolio model**
  : given a set of returns of different security items, determines the price,
    size, and timing of order requests;
    `class Model` in `src/core/sibyl/client` and its derived classes


## Programs in this repository

Common:
- **simserv**: backtesting simulation server
- **refclnt**: send order requests from pre-calculated reference target
               signals; intended for testing portfolio strategies

For *Fractal*:
- **train**: train an RNN using *Fractal*
- **rnnclnt**: send real-time order requests using RNNs trained by *Fractal*

For *Sophia*:
- **sophia**: send real-time order requests using RNNs trained by *Sophia*
              via interprocess communication (IPC) or over a network (TCP)
              with `sophia.py`; equivalent to **rnnclnt**
              (*Sophia*'s train.py is equivalent to **train**)
- **reshape_dataset**: batch preprocess (Reshaper model)
                       data in suitable format for *Sophia*


# How to use

## Sample data
[Releases page](https://github.com/junosan/Sibyl/releases) includes sample
data and pre-trained RNNs to demonstrate the backtesting feature.
To try them,

- See **Directory structure** section below
- Install the prerequisite libraries/repositories;
  *Fractal* and *Eigen* are required, *Sophia* (*Theano*, *ZeroMQ*) is optional
  - *Fractal* (requires *CUDA*)
    - Install to `/usr/local/{include,lib}`
    - If the compiler generates an error about `isnan` during building,
      replace the noted part with `std::isnan`
  - *Sophia* (requires *Theano* & *CUDA*)
    - Clone to `$ROOT/Sophia/src`
    - Make sure *Theano* (including *libgpuarray*) is 
      [installed properly](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano_versions/dev/install_ubuntu.html);
      `THEANO_FLAGS=device=cuda0 python -c "import pygpu; import theano"`
      should not generate any error
    - *ZeroMQ*: install to `/usr/local/{include,lib}`;
      *cppzmq* is header-only and should be installed to `/usr/local/include`
  - *Eigen*: header-only; install to `/usr/local/include/Eigen`
- Extract and put the data files and RNN models in their respective directories
  - Zipped market data as `$ROOT/MATLAB/Data/$DATE.zip`
  - RNN workspace directories as `$ROOT/workspace/$WORKSPACE_NAME`
- See **Backtesting** sections below for launching backtests with either
  *Fractal* or *Sophia*
  - Compile `simserv` and `rnnclnt`/`sophia`
  - Script files and config files in `run/rnn` (for *Fractal*)
    and `run/sophia` (for *Sophia*) are preconfigured to launch
    backtests on the sample data with appropriate model parameters
  - In either directory, run `./run_g_list.sh date.list`
- On a different window or in `screen` or `tmux`,
  `watch -n1 cat $ROOT/Sibyl/bin/state/client_cur.log` while the client
  is running to monitor the progress
- Using `net.sh` in `run/rnn` or `run/sophia` along with *KiwoomAgent* will
  launch live-trading with exactly the same Return/Reshaper/RNN/Portfolio model

## Directory structure

The script files included in directory `run` show how to train,
backtest, and execute live trades.
They assume the following directory structure.
`MATLAB` is just a name here, and is not a requirement.

```
    $ROOT (a base directory, not /)
      MATLAB
        Data (zipped plain text market data for each date)
        DataV (zipped transformed binary data for each date)
        fractal
          DataV (unzipped and split into train/dev set for training)
      Sibyl (this repository, cloned)
        src (source code)
        run (script and config files)
        bin (compiled binary)
      Sophia
        src (Sophia repository, cloned)
        run (script files for training)
      reshaped_dataset (batch preprocessed data for Sophia)
      workspace (RNN models saved here)
```


## Preparing data
This repository does not contain materials for preparing the data, but
it is still discussed below for completeness.

### Collecting real-time intraday market data
See [KiwoomScribe](https://github.com/junosan/KiwoomScribe) for data format.

*KiwoomScribe* collects ca. 500 security items per day, and each security
item comprises 2 to 4 plain text files (trade events, order book events, etc).
Data is ca. 30 MB compressed (ca. 900 MB raw) for each date.
Zipped for each date and placed in `$ROOT/MATLAB/Data` as `$YYYYMMDD.zip`.

### Converting market data to `.raw`/`.ref` files (Return model)
These are binary files for training RNNs.
See `src/core/rnn/TradeDataSet.cc` for binary data formats.
The implementation of transformation from raw market data to these files
is not a part of this repository.

- `.raw`: vectorized raw market data;
          after preprocessing by `class Reshaper`, becomes the input for RNN
- `.ref`: reference trade signals derived from market data;
          after preprocessing by `class Reshaper`, becomes the target for RNN

Zipped for each date and placed in `$ROOT/MATLAB/DataV` as `$YYYYMMDD.zip`,
containing data for specific security items of interest to be fed to RNNs
for training.

### Splitting train/dev/test sets
Use script files in `$ROOT/MATLAB/fractal`
(these script files are contained in `sample_data.tar.gz`)
- (Optional) Run `gen_rand_datalist.sh` and `parse_datalist.sh` to randomly
  designate specific dates to be put in dev set (stored as `devset.txt`)
- Edit and run `prepare_data.sh`
  - this unzips the files from `$ROOT/MATLAB/DataV`
    to `$ROOT/MATLAB/fractal/DataV` and creates a sequence list `list.txt`
  - make sure only the binary data for train + dev set are in
    `$ROOT/MATLAB/DataV` (binary data aren't needed for the test set)
- Edit and run `split_dataset.sh`
  - this takes a list of dates to be put in the dev set from `devset.txt`
    and splits the dataset
  - results are two files `train.list` and `dev.list` containing relative
    paths (excluding extension) to the sequences in each dataset
  - this dataset is used both for *Fractal* and *Sophia*;
    for *Sophia*, an additional `reshape_dataset` step is needed -- see below


## Training/backtesting/live-trading using *Fractal*

### Training
- Compile `train` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/train`
  - choose the TradeNet (which defines the neural net architecture) and
    Reshaper in `train.cc`
  - `make clean`, then `make`
  - assumes required libraries installed in the global zone
    (`/usr/local/include`, `/usr/local/lib`)
- Run `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/train/train_batch_0.sh`
  - set paths of binaries, dataset, and workspace in the script file
  - multiple training sessions can be queued to be run in sequence
  - multiple training sessions can be run simultaneously if you have
    multiple GPUs; see `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/train/train_batch_1.sh`

### Backtesting
- Compile `simserv` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/simserv` with `make`
- Compile `rnnclnt` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/rnnclnt`
  - choose the TradeNet and Reshaper in `rnnclnt.cc`;
    these should be the same as those chosen during training
  - `make clean`, then `make`
- Use script files in `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/rnn`
  - `run_g.sh`: runs backtest for a single date `$1`
    - `workspace.list` specifies which trained RNN to use
      (can run multiple RNNs in ensemble)
    - `simserv`, `class Model`, and `class Reshaper` each take a configuration
      file as referred to in `run_g.sh`, which need to be modified as needed
    - see **Screenshots** section below for instructions on live monitoring
  - `run_g_list.sh`: using `run_g.sh`, run all dates in a date list file `$1`
  - `run_g_scan_param.sh`: using `run_g_list.sh`, repeatedly run full date list
                           while changing configuration files
                           (for performing parameter optimization)

### Live-trading
- Launch an agent (e.g., KiwoomAgent), possibly on a different machine
- Run `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/rnn/net.sh`
  - set address & port of the agent's machine in the script file
  - set configuration files referred to in the script file


## Training/backtesting/live-trading using *Sophia*

### Training
- Compile `reshape_dataset` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/reshape_dataset`
  - choose the Reshaper in `reshape_dateset.cc`
  - `make clean`, then `make`
- Run `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/reshape_dataset/reshape.sh` after setting paths in
  the script file
  - this assumes data prepared as specified in **Preparing data** section above
- Run `$ROOT/Sophia/run/train_0.sh`
  - neural net structure is configured directly in `$ROOT/Sophia/src/train.py`
  - similar to above, multiple training sessions can be run in sequence or in
    parallel

### Backtesting/live-trading
- Compile `simserv` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/simserv` with `make`
- Compile `sophia` from `$ROOT/Sibyl/src/sophia`
  - choose the Reshaper in `sophia.cc`; should be the same as that for training
  - `make clean`, then `make`
- Use script files in `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/sophia`
  - they function identically to those in `$ROOT/Sibyl/run/rnn`


# Screenshots

While operating, client updates `$ROOT/Sibyl/bin/state/client_cur.log`
in real-time to show a summary of what's going on.
This file can be `watch cat`'ed in the terminal to monitor the current state
of backtesting/live-trading (requires UTF-8 support in the terminal emulator).
Note that this is only meant to be a quick-glance summary; full logs are
stored in `$ROOT/Sibyl/bin/log`, in human-readable and binary formats.

Sample screenshots from some different models:

<img src="readme/client_state_0.png" width="566"/>

<img src="readme/client_state_1.png" width="561"/>

## Statistics legend
- `bal u`: unused balance
- `bal b_o`: balance staged as buy orders
- `evl cnt`: estimated value of securities in hand, not staged in the market
- `evl s_o`: estimated value of securities staged as sell orders
- `evl tot`: grand total
- `r+#.##%`: profit rate wrt the reference prices (last date's ending prices)
- `s+#.##%`: profit rate wrt the starting prices
- `bal/quant/evt`: balance (or estimated value)/quantity/events
- `[t_o]`: original relative price tick at which orders were placed
- `[s 0]`: at immediate sell price (`ps0` = highest bid price)
- `[b 0]`: at immediate buy price (`pb0` = lowest ask price)
- `[f+t]`: fee + taxes

Screenshots above show statistics only for the 0-th relative price ticks
(immediate orders only), as only these were assumed in the
Return/Portfolio/Reshaper models in use. However, the simulator is able to
handle arbitrarily priced limit-orders within the collected tick data range.

## Charts legend
- top chart (`u / tot`): ratio of unused balance
- middle chart (`rate_s`): profit rate wrt the starting prices
                           (in %, auto-scales)
- bottom chart (`index`): market's main index (in above screenshots, KOSPI200)
- *x*-axis: major tick - 1 hour, minor tick - 30 minutes;
            starts at 09:00:00
- `â`: between starting/ending values of a rising segment
- `â`: between starting/ending values of a falling segment
- `|`: between high/low values of a segment (if not masked by above)
- `-`: no change
